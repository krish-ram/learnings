In case of setting up a new repository, 

1. Create a repository from the Github profile. Donot create a Readme file when you are setting up, as this may not show you further steps.

2. Go to the folder in your local machine, where your files to be added to the repository are located (or path where you intend to create repo related files).

3. Once inside the folder, do a : git init 
This will initialize the folder to a git repo

4. Once you have created files or folders, do a : git status
This will show you the list of files added or modified 

5. Add the files which need to be pushed to the repository. For this, do : git add <file-path>
	To add all the files, do a : git add .


6. Next you have to connect the local folder to your git repo. 
		
		Do a : git remote add origin git@github.com:<username>/<repo-name>.git

This is a one time activity. Once the repo is connected, from next time, when ever you commit a change from this folder, it will go to this repo

7. Now that we have connected, we have to push the changes to the repo. So do a : git push origin master

Master is default branch where all the code goes. Any branch created is out of master.
