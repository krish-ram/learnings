First we have to Create a link between our Github and our local machine. We make use of the ssh for this. 

For windows, we have to install and use the Git Bash (https://git-scm.com/downloads). For mac, we can continue to use the Terminal.

We have to create a ssh id, which will generate a public key along and we have to add this to the Github repository under the Settings tab. 

	The command to generate an SSH key : 
	
		ssh-keygen -t rsa -C "your_email@example.com"
		
	This may ask for a default path and you can continue with the same.

Now you may go to the .ssh folder and look for id_rsa.pub

		Path for Mac: /Users/<username>/.ssh
		Path for Windows: /c/Users/Lakshmi/.ssh

Copy the contents of the id_rsa.pub file and paste it in your "SSH and GPG keys" section (https://github.com/settings/keys) within the Settings Page of your Github Account.

You may add the contents under the "New SSH Key" and save it. 

This will establish a connection between your system and local



You have to configure the Username and Email address in your system, so that this matches to the Github account.

Run these in the GitBash / Terminal:

		git config --global user.email "your_Email@address.com"
		git config --global user.name "Your name"

Now you are all set to create a new repository or clone an Existing Repo
